## List of Exercises

- add_binary.py
    - Given two binary strings a and b, return their sum as a binary string.
- climbing_stairs.py
- first_occurence.py
    - Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.
- length_last_word.py
    - Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.
- Longest_Common_Prefix.py
    - find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of string
- merge_two_lists.py
    - Merge two linked lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
- plus_one.py
    - Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.
- remove_duplicates.py
    - Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.
- remove_element.py
    - Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place.
- roman_to_integer.py
    - Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.
- search_insert.py
    - Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
- two_sums.py
    - Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
- palindrome.py
    - Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
- valid_parentheses.py
    - Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
- sqrt.py
    - Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.
- remove_duplicates_linked_list.py
    - Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.
- merged_sorted_list.py
    - You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively. Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
- binary_tree_inorder_traversal.py
    - Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.
- same_tree.py
    - Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
- simetrical_tree.py
    - Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).
- level_order_transversal.py:
    - Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).
- level_order_transversal_zigzag.py:
    - Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).
